- [ ] Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.

    - It's like React for your backend. It adds extra functionality like Routing and Middleware support. Allows us to build RESTfull web services that work with JSON.

- [ ] Describe Middleware?

    - They have access to the request object, response object and the next function. We can also use Middleware to add extra features to Express.

- [ ] Describe a Resource?

    - Anything on your system that you want to manage.

- [ ] What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?

    - An API can return status codes that can help clients know what the issue with their request is.

- [ ] How can we partition our application into sub-applications?

    - Using express.Router() can help us partition our application into more managable chunks.
